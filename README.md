**Introduction**

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The goal is to build a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Features are extracted using PCA, and the target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent.

**Installation**

Clone the repository:

cd credit-card-fraud-detection

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

**Usage**

Data Preprocessing: Model Training: Model Evaluation:

**Model**

The model uses a RandomForestClassifier to detect fraudulent transactions. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.

**Results**

Accuracy: 100% Precision: 100% Recall: 100% F1 Score: 92% AUC-ROC: 0.95

**Conclusion**

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning for credit card fraud detection through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
